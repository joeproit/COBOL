3. Calculates the updated account balance by adding the deposit amount to the current account balance.

4. Converts the updated account balance to a string format.

5. Constructs a receipt string by concatenating the customer name, deposit amount, and updated balance string.

6. Opens a file named 'RECEIPT.DAT' for output.

7. Checks the file status after opening the file to ensure that it was successfully opened.

8. Writes the receipt string to the file.

9. Checks the file status after writing to ensure that the write operation was successful.

10. Closes the file.

11. Checks the file status after closing the file to ensure that the closing operation was successful.

12. If any errors occur during file operations, such as opening, writing, or closing the file, the code displays an error message and stops the program.
