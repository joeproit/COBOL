## Description

The provided code is a batch processing program that performs the following tasks:

1. Defines the file control section, specifying the input file "SALES.DAT" and its attributes such as organization, access mode, and file status.

2. Defines the structure of the records in the "SALES.DAT" file, including fields for sale ID, sale date, product ID, quantity, and sale price.

3. Includes variables in the working-storage section to hold various values during program execution, such as WS-FileStatus, WS-EndOfFile, TotalSales, and TotalQuantity.

4. Begins the procedure division with the "Begin" paragraph.

5. Opens the input file "SALES.DAT" for reading and checks the file status to ensure it was opened successfully.

6. Reads the first record from the input file and displays its contents if it is not at the end of the file.

7. Enters a loop that continues until the end of the file is reached.

8. Within the loop, performs calculations to update TotalSales and TotalQuantity based on the values of the Quantity and SalePrice fields from each record.

9. Reads the next record from the input file and checks if it is at the end of the file.

10. After exiting the loop, displays the TotalSales and TotalQuantity values.

11. Closes the input file and checks the file status to ensure it was closed successfully.

12. Stops the program.
