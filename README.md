# COBOL Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of COBOL programs demonstrating a variety of skills and techniques. Each program serves as a standalone example of a specific aspect of COBOL programming. These programs were created as part of my COBOL learning journey and are maintained here as a portfolio for potential employers to review.

To date, my training has come in 4 forms:
1. Unstructured videos (Mostly Youtube)
2. Unstructured reading (Mostly Google Books)
3. Online courses (IBM, PluralSight, Udemy)
4. Trial and Error

My primary development environment is Visual Studio Code, leveraging the IBM Z Open Editor Extension in Windows 10 x64. I have also been leveraging MVS 3.8j and MicroFocus Visual COBOL Personal Edition Trial as a part of my learning environment.

## File Handling

"FileHandling.cbl" demonstrates the basic file handling capabilities of COBOL. It shows how to open, read, write, and close files, as well as how to handle common file errors.

## Report Generation

"ReportGeneration.cbl" and "SalesReport.cbl" are examples of COBOL programs that generate business reports. They read data from a file, perform calculations, and format the results as a report.

## Data Manipulation

"DataManipulation.cbl" shows how to use COBOL's data manipulation features. It includes examples of arithmetic operations, string manipulation, and data conversion.

## Batch Processing

"BatchProcessing.cbl" is a COBOL program designed to process large amounts of data efficiently. It demonstrates techniques like block I/O and serial file processing.

## Error Handling

"ErrorHandling.cbl" is a COBOL program that includes comprehensive error checking and exception handling. It shows how to catch and handle both file errors and runtime errors.

## Database Integration

"DatabaseIntegration.cbl" is an example of a COBOL program that interacts with a database. It uses embedded SQL to query the database and COBOL to process the results.

## About Me

I'm a dedicated and passionate IT Professional, always seeking to expand my knowledge and apply my skills to solve real-world problems. I'm open to job opportunities where I can use my COBOL skills.
